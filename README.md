## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Webpack

### What I learned

- I've learned how to use and configure webpack and how to deploy to github pages via dist (docs) folder.
- I've learned how to do routing on vanilla so the links, button links work well on github pages.
- I've also learned how to separate concerns in bigger application to separate page modules and smaller components (nav, footer, buttons).
- Making a correct folder structure right at the beginning of the project was the core of the success of making this webpage work.

### Continued development

- In future i plan to add functional backend - Working Login and Registration, Accounts and functional order system and cart.
- I am gonna add more pages and content to existing pages as well.
